To run this project:
`yarn install` and `yarn dev`

This is just a showcase of my foundamental react skill
Future improve:
   I would use the state control package to save the cart list. (like Mobx)
   I didn't use button tag to create button but div. Since I want to finish it in 4 hour. So I chose div, cause I can change its style easier.
